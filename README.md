## HealthCare Data Analysis and Performance Optimization
### **LOWELL GENERAL HOSPITAL PERFORMANCE METRICS ANALYSIS: KEY INDICATORS FOR PATIENT CARE IMPROVEMENT**

### **Objective**
To analyze and assess hospital performance using three key KPIs that measure efficiency and patient experience, ensuring improved healthcare quality and safety.

1. **Average Occupancy Rate**
2. **Staff Responsiveness Top Box Score**
3. **Unassisted Patient Falls per 1,000 Patient Days**

### **Purpose**
To identify patterns and trends impacting patient care and provide insights and recommendations to improve hospital performance.

## **Dataset Analysis**
- **Time Frame:** Data collected from **Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 1, 2024**
- **Total Records:** 60  
- **Frequency of Data Collection:** Monthly  
- **Key Metrics:**  
  - **Average Licensed Bed Occupancy Rate:** Measures hospital bed utilization.  
  - **Unassisted Fall Rate per 1,000 Patient Days:** Assesses patient safety by tracking falls without staff assistance.  
  - **Staff Responsiveness Domain Top Box Score:** Evaluates patient-reported staff responsiveness quality.  
  - **Unassisted Fall %:** Percentage of falls that occurred without staff presence.  
  - **Staff Responsiveness Domain Top Box Score %:** Percentage of patients rating staff responsiveness highly.  
  - **Staff Responsiveness Top Box Score Benchmark:** A comparative benchmark for staff responsiveness scores.

## **Bed Occupancy Impact on Staff Responsiveness and Unassisted Falls**

### **Bed Occupancy Rate**
- Ranges from **0.81 to 1.01**, with an average of **0.96**, indicating high demand for beds, possibly leading to resource strain.

### **Staff Responsiveness**
- Scores vary between **0.53 and 0.73**, with an average of **0.63**, indicating moderate performance, with room for improvement in assisting patients.

### **Unassisted Falls**
- Ranges from **0.10 to 0.34**, with an average of **0.26**, showing a safety concern that could increase with high bed occupancy and slower staff response.

## **Bed Occupancy & Staff Performance Trends**
### **At Low Bed Occupancy (0.81):**  
- Staff responsiveness is high (**above 0.65 benchmark**).  
- Unassisted fall rates are low.  

### **At High Bed Occupancy (1.01):**  
- Staff responsiveness drops significantly.  
- Unassisted fall rates increase.  

📌 **Insight:** Higher bed occupancy strains staff capacity, leading to slower response times and increased patient safety risks.

## **Insights from KPI Trends (2020-2024)**
- **Bed Occupancy** remains high (**0.96 – 0.97**), indicating **constant demand**.  
- **Staff Responsiveness** declined (**2020 – 2023**) but showed a slight improvement in **2024**.  
- **Unassisted Falls** increased (**2020 - 2023**) but **improved slightly in 2024**.  
- **Lower staff responsiveness leads to more unassisted falls**, highlighting the need for better staffing.  
- **Improvements in 2024** show progress, but **more efforts are needed**.

## **KPI Trends by Month and Quarter**
### **Trend Observed**
- **High bed occupancy in Q1 (Jan–Mar)** consistently remains the peak.  
- **Staff responsiveness is lowest in Q1**, declining as occupancy rises.  
- **Unassisted falls are highest in Q1**, likely linked to reduced staff availability.  

### **Possible Factors Influencing the Trends**
- Increased patient admissions due to **seasonal illnesses**.  
- Heavy workload causes **staff tiredness**, leading to slower response times.  
- High bed occupancy reduces supervision, **increasing the risk of falls**.  
- Lack of **staffing adjustments during peak times** impacts patient safety.
