# HealthCare Data Analysis and Performance Optimization
**LOWELL GENERAL HOSPITAL PERFORMANCE METRICS ANALYSIS: KEY INDICATORS FOR PATIENT CARE IMPROVEMENT**

**Objective**: To analyze and assess hospital performance using three key KPIs that measure efficiency and patient experience, ensuring improved healthcare quality and safety.
1. Average Occupancy Rate 
2. Staff Responsiveness Top Box Score
3. Unassisted Patient Falls per 1,000 Patient Days 
**Purpose**: To identify patterns and trends impacting patient care and provide insights and recommendations to improve hospital performance.

**DATASET ANALYSIS:**

•	Time Frame :Data Collected from 1/Jan/2000 to 1/Dec/2024
•	 Total Records – 60
•	 Frequency of data collected: Monthly 
•	 Average Licensed Bed Occupancy Rate: Measures hospital bed utilization.
•	 Unassisted Fall Rate per 1,000 Patient Days: Assesses patient safety by tracking falls without staff assistance.
•	 Staff Responsiveness Domain Top Box Score: Evaluates patient-reported staff responsiveness quality.
•	 Unassisted Fall %: Percentage of falls that occurred without staff presence.
•	 Staff Responsiveness Domain Top Box Score %: Percentage of patients rating staff responsiveness highly.
•	 Staff Responsiveness Top Box Score Benchmark: A comparative benchmark for staff responsiveness scores.

**BED OCCUPANCY IMPACT ON STAFF RESPONSIVENESS AND UNASSISTED FALLS**
Bed Occupancy Rate
•	Ranges from 0.81 to 1.01, with an average of 0.96 indicates high demand for beds, possibly leading to  resource strain.
Staff Responsiveness
•	Scores vary between 0.53 and 0.73, with an average of 0.63% indicating Moderate performance, with room for improvement in assisting patients.        
Unassisted Falls
•	Ranges from 0.10  to 0.34, with an average of 0.26%, showing a safety concern that could increase with high bed occupancy and slower staff response.

**Bed Occupancy & Staff Performance Trends**
**At low bed occupancy (0.81)** 
•	Staff responsiveness is high (above 0.65 benchmark)
•	Unassisted fall rates are low
**At high bed occupancy (1.01)**
•	Staff responsiveness drops significantly
•	Unassisted fall rates increase

This trend suggests that higher bed occupancy strains staff capacity, leading to slower response times and increased patient safety risks.

**The Relationship Between Staff Responsiveness, Unassisted Falls, and Bed Occupancy in Healthcare**

**Insights from the KPI Trends by Year (2020-2024)**
•	Bed Occupancy remains high (0.96 – 0.97), indicating Constant demand.
•	Staff responsiveness declined (2020 – 2023) but showed a slight improvement in 2024.
•	Unassisted fall increased ( 2020 -2023) but improved slightly in 2024.
•	Lower Staff responsiveness leads to more unassisted falls, highlighting the need for better staffing.
•	Improvements in 2024 show progress, but more efforts are needed.

**KPI Trends by Month and Quarter**
**Trend Observed**
•	High bed occupancy in Q1 (Jan–Mar) consistently remains the peak.
•	Staff responsiveness is lowest in Q1, declining as occupancy rises.
•	Unassisted falls are highest in Q1, likely linked to reduced staff availability.
**Possible Factors Influencing the Trends**
•	Increased Patient Admissions due to Seasonal Illnesses
•	Heavy workload causes staff tiredness leading to slower response times.
•	High bed occupancy reduces supervision, which increases the risk of falls.
•	Lack of staffing adjustments during peak times impacts patient safety.

**Year-by-Year Percentage% Changes for 3 KPI’s**

**Insights from the Data**
•	Bed Occupancy Rate - Stable with slight increases, indicating good management.
•	Staff Responsiveness % -Slight decline, suggesting potential staffing or response time issues.
•	Unassisted Fall % -Increased, highlighting the need for better fall prevention.

**Recommendations and Potential healthcare improvement**

**Bed Occupancy Rate:**
•	Optimize discharge planning to reduce overcrowding.
•	Better admission and scheduling to manage patient flow smoothly.
•	Potential Improvement: +5-10% in operational efficiency.
**Staff Responsiveness %:**
•	Hire more nurses during peak hours to improve response times.
•	Use real-time communication tools for faster response.
•	Potential Improvement: +5-10% improvement in responsiveness.
**Unassisted Fall %:**
•	Strengthen fall prevention programs and regular checks on high-risk patients.
•	Increase nurse rounds to check on patients more often.
•	Potential Improvement: -10-20% reduction in unassisted falls.



**Conclusion:** Implementing these recommendations can lead to a 15-25% overall Improvement in patient safety, operational efficiency, and staff responsiveness, enhancing healthcare quality.
